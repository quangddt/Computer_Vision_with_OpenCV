# Computer Vision with OpenCV
This repo contains jupyter notebooks where I use the OpenCV-Python's [Tutorial](http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to explore its features and do some expreriments. I also watch and the series of Image and Video Analysis from https://pythonprogramming.net/ during working on this project so I listed it here and a reference.
